Use a docs directory for documentaiton
* sphinx cannot find source files above the docs directorsy so need to have everytning inside the docs directory
* ndsphinix extension allows to include ipynb files in the toc tree

Current issues:
sphinx uses pandoc, pandoc ommits html img tags from markdown
  Solution: use markdown images ![eqn](./img/eqn1.png){width=200px} but alignment is an issue 
  solution:  <div style="text-align: center">![eqn](./img/eqn1.png){width=200px}</div>
Sphinx uses mathjax: mathjax do not like indents inside equation and align enviroments

When testing jupiter sphinx worked for rst files but not for html converted notebook files. ok you should embed he widget coe from the note book in a java script file for that work
finding: the way i have implemented the roll pitchyaw is not interactible: i.e. cannot call python code
there isa seperate framework to working with widgets -  i.e the user input is linked to a widget state through java script

Todo: add collapsibility using divtags custom css and javascript to show answers. The nbsphinx python code can be edited to include additional rst directived based on cell meta data
i.e., hide only input, or collapse only input etc.

There are fixes already in issues section 

jupiter book is a bettr tool for this level of customization
